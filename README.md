# Transport protocols simulator library

This small library is a project under construction, whose main purpose
will be to power the simulations running in the background of a
graphic visualizer of transport protocols.
It is aimed to support the visualizations of *Automatic Repeat Request* protocols
as *Stop-and-Wait*, *Go-Back-N* and *Selective Repeat*, of which only *Stop-and-Wait*
is currently implemented.

For now you can find examples of how to use the library in the tests under `js/tests` in
the project repository.
